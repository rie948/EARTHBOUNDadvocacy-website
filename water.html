        Water is essential for all life on Earth, supporting ecosystems, human survival, and marine
        biodiversity. Oceans, rivers, and lakes play a vital role in regulating climate and sustaining food chains.
    </p>
    <p>
        This topic is important because marine life contributes to oxygen production, food supply,
        and ecological balance. Healthy waters mean a healthy planet.
    </p>
    <p>
        Marine ecosystems currently face problems such as plastic pollution, oil spills,
        overfishing, and ocean acidification caused by climate change.
    </p>
    <p>
        Protecting water resources involves reducing plastic use, conserving water,
        supporting clean-up initiatives, and spreading awareness about marine conservation.
