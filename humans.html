    <p>
        Humans are deeply connected to the environment, relying on nature for food, shelter, water,
        and resources necessary for survival. Every action humans take has an impact on the planet,
        whether positive or negative.
    </p>
    <p>
        This relationship is important because human well-being depends on a healthy environment.
        When ecosystems are damaged, people suffer through health issues, food shortages, and
        environmental disasters.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, humans face problems such as pollution, overconsumption, and climate change.
        These issues lead to habitat destruction, poor air quality, and rising global temperatures.
    </p>
    <p>
        Helping begins with sustainable living—reducing waste, conserving energy, supporting
        environmental policies, and educating communities about responsible environmental practices.
